## CLRS in Golang

I think this will be a work in progress for quite a while, since it's not a very high-priority project. I do intend to get through all 1,1313 pages, though.

[Here's](https://edutechlearners.com/download/Introduction_to_algorithms-3rd%20Edition.pdf) the book (PDF)

## Todo
- Modularize the code better and make each chapter its own package
- Learn more about the [testing](https://pkg.go.dev/testing) package so we don't have a repeat of [this](https://github.com/clairdl/clrs-go/commit/8aeb6d8eeee705e6b78ded3c175b4a0ab20187c2)(passing callbacks around) :)
